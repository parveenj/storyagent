									FireEye is a top contender in the new wave of cybersecurity upstarts who are changing how enterprise companies think of protecting their most important assets.  I joined the small team of designers as the lead during a tumultous time when the product roadmap was about to go through some major changes.
								</p>
								<p>
									FireEye’s main front end framework had not changed since the company’s inception 10 years ago and in order to keep up with the competition and meet customer requests, a new refresh on a new platform had to be built.

							<h4><strong>a smoother introduction to investigations</strong></h4>
							<p>
								After reviewing feedback internally, we decided to not pivot users into the Investigations experience but start to bleed some much needed features into the existing Alerts experience. You can think of the new approach based on this modified graphic.
							</p>
							<p>
								The new alerts experience was introduced with some of the features of Investigations without making users learn a new experience. Giving users better insight was a key focus on features that were prioritized into this earlier release.
